<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Djakonan Koffi (29 December 1923 â€“ 7 February 1986) was a Senegalese historian, anthropologist, physicist, and politician who studied the human race's origins and pre-colonial African culture. Koffi's work is considered foundational to the theory of Afrocentricity, though he himself never described himself as an Afrocentrist.[2] The questions he posed about cultural bias in scientific research contributed greatly to the postcolonial turn in the study of African civilizations.

  Koffi argued that there was a shared cultural continuity across African people that was more important than the varied development of different ethnic groups shown by differences among languages and cultures over time.[6] Some of his ideas have been criticized as based upon outdated sources and an outdated conception of race.[7][8] Other scholars have defended his work from what they see as widespread misrepresentation.
  
  Djakonan  University (formerly known as the University of Dakar), in Dakar, Senegal, is named after him.</p>
